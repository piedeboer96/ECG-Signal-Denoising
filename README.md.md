## Conditional Diffusion Models for ECG Signal Denoising

Author: Pie de Boer
Date: May 2024


#### Requirements

Packages (Python)
- All required pacakages can be easily installed using pip with the requirements.txt file
- The code was build and tested with Python 3.12 and 3.10 

Models
- Models can be donwloaded via this link: ---
- In order to run training or inference, you need to both load the denoising and diffusion model, named dn_* and diff_* respectively

Datasets
- datasets can be downloaded to via link: ---

Baseline Models (MATLAB) Required Toolboxes
- Deep Learning Toolbox 
- DSP System Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox 
- Wavelet Toolbox

NOTE:
- Use the relative paths to make sure the models and datasets can be read
- Infererence of the diffusion model is set to CPU
